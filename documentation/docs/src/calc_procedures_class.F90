!!    The procedures class is used for two purposes. Wavefunctions possess 
!!    "implemented" and "tasks" objects, which are both instances of the class 
!!    calculation procedures. If one of the tasks requested is not implemented
!!    for the wavefunction in question, the program stops, letting the user know
!!    that the requested functionality is not a part of eT (yet).
!!
!!    Tasks are determined during the read of the input (see the main program).
!!    Implemented are set by the wavefunction's initialization routine.
