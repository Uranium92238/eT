!!    Kinds module
!!    Written by Eirik F. Kj√∏nstad and Sarai D. Folkestad, 2018
!!
!!    Defines a set of kinds in terms of precision. Usage:
!!
!!       In declarations:   "real(dp) :: foo", "integer(i15) :: foo_int", etc.
!!       In record-lengths: "recl=dp*200" (200 double precision numbers per record)
!!
!
   implicit none
!
   integer, parameter :: dp  = selected_real_kind(15,307)
   integer, parameter :: qp  = selected_real_kind(33,4931)
   integer, parameter :: i15 = selected_int_kind(15)
   integer, parameter :: i6  = selected_int_kind(6)
!
end module kinds
