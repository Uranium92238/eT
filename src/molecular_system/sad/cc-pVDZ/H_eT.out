           S. D. Folkestad, E. F. Kjønstad, 2017-2018



  Initializing UHF wavefunction.

  Requested fractional uniform valence. Valence electrons will be
  distributed evenly in the highest molecular orbitals (if plural).

  :: Direct-integral Hartree-Fock self-consistent field solver
  :: E. F. Kjønstad, S. D. Folkestad, 2018

  A Roothan-Hall self-consistent field solver. In each iteration,
  the Roothan-Hall equation (or equations for unrestricted HF theory)
  are solved to provide the next orbital coefficients. From the new
  orbitals, a new density provides the next Fock matrix. The cycle
  repeats until the solution is self-consistent (as measured by
  the energy change).

  Initial AO density is core.

     Energy of initial guess:        -0.499278403420
     Number of electrons in guess:    1.000000000000
