!!    Save excited state 
!!    Written by Eirik F. Kjønstad, Mar 2019 
!!
!!    Saves an excited state to disk. Since the solvers 
!!    keep these vectors in full length, we receive a vector 
!!    in full length (n_es_amplitudes), and then distribute 
!!    the different parts of that vector to singles, doubles, etc.,
!!    files (if there are doubles, etc.).
!!
!!    NB! If n = 1, then the routine WILL REWIND the files before writing,
!!    thus DELETING every record in the file. For n >=2, we just append to
!!    the file. The purpose of this setup is that the files should be saved in 
!!    the correct order, from n = 1 to n = # states.
