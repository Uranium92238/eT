!!
!!    Constructs the intermediates X_vvvo and X_vooo
!!    used to compute the contributions to sigma_ai

!!
!!    g_lbic, g_lbjc, g_lbkc can be used for g_pcqd as well: 
!!    The p(i,j,k) can be set in dgemm and q(i,j,k) is defined by the array used
!!
!!    All permutations for i,j,k have to be considered due to the restrictions in the i,j,k loops
