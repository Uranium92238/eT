!!    Jacobian transpose transformation
!!    Written by Sarai D. Folkestad and Alexander C. Paul, Feb 2019
!!
!!    Calculates the transpose Jacobian transformation, i.e., the transformation
!!    by the transpose of the Jacobian matrix
!!
!!       A_mu,nu = < mu | exp(-T) [H, tau_nu] exp(T) | R >.
!!
!!    The transformation is performed as sigma^T = c^T A, where c is the vector
!!    sent to the routine.
