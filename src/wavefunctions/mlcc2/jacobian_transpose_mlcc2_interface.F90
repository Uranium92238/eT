   module subroutine jacobian_transpose_transformation_mlcc2(wf, b)
!!
!!    Jacobian transpose transformation (MLCC2)
!!    Adapted by Sarai D. Folkestad, Jul 2019
!!
!!    Calculates the transpose Jacobian transformation, i.e., the transformation
!!    by the transpose of the Jacobian matrix
!!
!!       A_mu,nu = < mu | exp(-T) [H, tau_nu] exp(T) | R >.
!!
!!    The transformation is performed as sigma^T = c^T A, where c is the vector
!!    sent to the routine. On exit, the vector c is equal to sigma (the transformed
!!    vector).
