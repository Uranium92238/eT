!!
!!    The term is calculated while batching over index a.

!!    Construct Omega doubles
!!    Written by Sarai D. Folkestad, Sep 2019
!!
!!    Constructs the doubles part of omega for MLCC2
!!
!!    Note that this is not used to solve MLCC2 equations, 
!!    but it is only used for debug of Jacobian matrix
!!
!!    omega_aibj = 1/Î”_aibj g_aibj + e_aibj s_aibj
