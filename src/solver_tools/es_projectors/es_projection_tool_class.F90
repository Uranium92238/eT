!!
!!    Vectors can be projected as follows:
!!
!!       call projection_tool%project(R)     (*)
!!
!!    Initialization depends on the calculation type; see descendants.
!!
!!    Note that the call (*) is usually not done for Davidson
!!    algorithms, where the actual projection in done inside the Davidson tool.
!!    Initialization is still handled by the projection tool.
