  :: Self-consistent field DIIS Hartree-Fock solver
  :: E. F. Kjønstad and S, D. Folkestad, 2018

  A DIIS-accelerated Roothan-Hall self-consistent field solver. A least-square 
  DIIS fit is performed on the previous Fock matrices and associated gradients. 
  Following the Roothan-Hall update of the density, the DIIS-fitted Fock matrix 
  is used to get the next orbital coefficients.

  :: Excited state engine
  :: E. F. Kjønstad, S. D. Folkestad, 2018

  Calculates the coupled cluster excitation vectors and excitation energies 
  

  This is a MLCC2 excited state calculation. The following tasks will be performed:

  - Cholesky decomposition of the ERI-matrix
  - Calculation of the ground state amplitudes (diis-algorithm)
  - Calculation of the ground state energy
  - Calculation of the right hand side core excitation vectors (davidson-algorithm) 
  
  - Calculation of the excitation energies (davidson-algorithm)


  :: Cholesky decomposition of electronic repulsion integrals solver
  :: E. F. Kjønstad, S. D. Folkestad, 2018

  Performs a Cholesky decomposition of the two-electron electronic repulsion 
  integrals in the atomic orbital basis,

  (ab|cd) = sum_J L_ab^J L_cd^J.

  Once the Cholesky basis has been determined, the vectors L^J are constructed 
  and stored to disk. These may either be used directly, or be transformed 
  to the MO basis for use in post-HF calculations.

  :: Davidson coupled cluster excited state solver
  :: E. F. Kjønstad, S. D. Folkestad, 2018

  A Davidson solver that calculates the lowest eigenvalues and  the right 
  or left eigenvectors of the Jacobian matrix, A. The eigenvalue  problem 
  is solved in a reduced space, the dimension of which is  expanded until 
  the convergence criteria are met.

  A complete description of the algorithm can be found in  E. R. Davidson, 
  J. Comput. Phys. 17, 87 (1975).
