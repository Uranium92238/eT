  4) Calculation of the excited state (non-linear davidson algorithm)
     Calculating right vectors

   - Non-linear Davidson coupled cluster excited state solver
  --------------------------------------------------------------

  A non-linear Davidson solver that calculates the lowest eigenvalues 
  and the right or left eigenvectors of the Jacobian matrix A. The eigenvalue 
  problem is solved in a reduced space for fixed energies, before the 
  energies are updated and a new reduced space built.

  See C. Hättig and F. Weigend, J. Chem. Phys. 113, 5154 (2000).
